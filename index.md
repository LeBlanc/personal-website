Andrew LeBlanc is a writer and programmer. He lives in New York city where he manages a rooftop garden and searches for strange new foods to eat.

Here are some of the things he works on:

## <a href="https://www.everribbon.com">EverRibbon</a>

EverRibbon provides a simple way for small causes and individuals to raise money online. Causes are provided with a page where they can describe their cause, share it with people they know via social media, and collect donations via credit cards and bank accounts.

## <a href="https://www.everbutton.com">EverButton</a>

EverButton provides small businesses and organizations with simple payment buttons where the entire payment experience will happen on their own site. All they need to do is copy and paste a simple embed code and they are 100% set up to accept payments online.

## <a href="http://nlp.naturalparsing.com">NLP API</a>

I wrote a simple API for the <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml">Stanford Parser</a>. You can pass a sentence to the API and it will return the parsed sentence tree in either JSON or JSONP. 

## <a href="http://adjectivefor.com">Adjective For</a>

Adjective For lets you find all of the common adjectives for a given noun. We parsed sentences from sources like Wikipedia and NYT to create a mapping of nouns to adjectives, ranked by how often the pairings appear.
