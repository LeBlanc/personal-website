## Hello, my name is Andrew LeBlanc!

I am a full stack web developer originally from Texas. I primarily program in some combination of ruby, javascript, and php.

I currently work for myself on the projects below, but I am available for consulting/contract work. My specialties include API development, API integrations, security, payments, asynchronous problems, and general backend work.

I wrote a simple API for the <a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml">Stanford Parser</a>. You can pass a sentence to the API and it will return the parsed sentence tree in either JSON or JSONP.
